# Quick Start Usage
**Repository:** `graphql-jena`  
**Description:** `The document demonstrates how to execute a basic GraphQL query on an RDF dataset using dataset graph APIs`  
<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: OGL-UK-3.0 -->

The following is a simple example of using these APIs with our [Dataset](schemas.md#dataset) schema to make a very basic
GraphQL query against a dataset:

```java
DatasetGraph dsg = DatasetGraphFactory.createTxnMem();
RDFParserBuilder.create()
                .source("example-data.trig")
                .build()
                .parse(dsg);

DatasetExecution executor = new DatasetExecution(dsg);

// Define our query
String query = """
query {
    quads {
        subject {
            kind
            value
        }
    }
}""";
ExecutionResult result = executor.execute(query);

// Do something with the results, it's a bit clunky as GraphQL returns everything as a Map<String, Object>
Map<String, Object> data = result.getData();
if (data.containsKey("quads")) {
    List<Map<String, Object>> quads = data.get("quads");
    for (Map<String, Object> quad : quads) {
        Map<String, Object> subject = quad.get("subject");
        System.out.println(subject.get("value"));
    }
}
```

A more typical use case is to expose a GraphQL endpoint as part of a Fuseki server which can be done by modifying your
Fuseki configuration file e.g.

```ttl
fuseki:endpoint [ fuseki:operation graphql:graphql ;
                  ja:context [ ja:cxtName "graphql:executor" ;
                               ja:cxtValue "uk.gov.dbt.ndtp.jena.graphql.execution.DatasetExecutor" ];
                  fuseki:name "dataset-graphql" ];
```

See the [Fuseki Module](fuseki-module.md) for more detailed configuration instructions.
